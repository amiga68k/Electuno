File notes:
	'For' has been replaced by 'do-while' loop. I've noticed that 8-bit AVRs handle it faster. 
	Changed 'if-else' to 'switch-case' for test.
	Added pedal tone generator.
	Added volume controls for all parts ( lower, upper, pedal ).
	Fix variables for Arduino Due compatibility (Arduino Due cannot reset variables as 'uint8_t i;'. Correct mode is 'uint8_t i = 0;' )
	
Problems:
	This function generates a lot of noise in the higher notes; If the wave is sharper, the noise is more noticeable.
	Perhaps the problem is in the way of mixing the drawbars into a single array and then reproducing it.
