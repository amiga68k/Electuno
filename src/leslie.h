File notes:
	Rewrite two Leslie() function. Remove some for/do/while loops for better performance.
	New phase tremolo effect when LESLIE option is 2 ( #defile LESLIE 2 ).
	Added an improved low pass filter for LESLIE option 2 ( #defile LESLIE 2 ).

Problems:
	A lot of noises in general, but it seems that on the drum part it is not so much.
	High pass filter generates a lot of noise.
	Horn part generates a lot of noise
